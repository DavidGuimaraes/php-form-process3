		<h1>Form Data Process With PHP 3</h1>
		<h3>By David Guimaraes, Computer Engineer</h3>
		<p>This series of little project are being done in order to actually start doing things with the PHP
			programming language. This is a very basic app. All it does is: it gathers the data from an HTML 
			form and stores the data into variables for further processing. The only difference from this project 
			to the previous one is the structure of the project itself and header and footer sections are being 
			reused in all other pages.</p>
